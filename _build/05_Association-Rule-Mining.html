<h2 id="Overview">Overview<a class="anchor-link" href="#Overview"> </a></h2><p>Associations are relationships between objects. The idea behind association rule mining is to determine rules, that allow us to identify which objects may be related to a set of objects were already know. In the association mining terminology, we refer to the objects as <em>items</em>. A common example for association rule mining is basket analysis. A shopper puts items from a store into a basket. Once there are some items in the basket, it is possible to recommend associated items that are available in the store to the shopper.</p>

<p>In this example, the association between items is defined as "shoppers buy items together". More generally speaking, we have <em>transactions</em>, and in each transaction we observe a set of related objects. We apply association rule mining to a set of transactions to infer <em>association rules</em> that describe the associations between items.</p>
