    "Associations are relationships between objects. The idea behind association rule mining is to determine rules, that allow us to identify which objects may be related to a set of objects were already know. In the association mining terminology, we refer to the objects as *items*. A common example for association rule mining is basket analysis. A shopper puts items from a store into a basket. Once there are some items in the basket, it is possible to recommend associated items that are available in the store to the shopper. \n",

    "In this example, the association between items is defined as \"shoppers buy items together\". More generally speaking, we have *transactions*, and in each transaction we observe a set of related objects. We apply association rule mining to a set of transactions to infer *association rules* that describe the associations between items. \n",
